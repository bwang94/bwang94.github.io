	<h1>Global Communications Connectivity Index</h1>
	<h2><p>Definition</p></h2>
	The Global Communications Connectivity Index is an index that attempts to represent how well connected a country is to the rest of the world based on its populations' ability to communicate through electronic means.
	<h2><p>Purpose</p></h2>
	The purpose of this index is to give insight as to which countries have populations that are best connected to each other and to the rest of the world.
	<h2><p>Methodology</p></h2>
	The Global Communications Connectivity Index is a score made up of a single number between 0 and 100. The Index has four subscores for each of the following four categories:
	<ul>
		<li>Mobile Connectivity (30 points)</li>
		<li>Internet Connectivity (30 points)</li>
		<li>Landline Connectivity (15 points)</li>
		<li>Power Accessibility (25 points)</li>
	</ul>
	Each subscore is first scored out of 100 points, then brought down to its appropriate weight in the total score calculation.
	<h3>Mobile Connectivity</h3>
	The Mobile Connectivity subscore is directly based on a country's Mobile Subscriptions per 100 people. This subscore has two components:
	<ul>
		<li>Saturation Component (80 points)</li>
		<li>Efficiency Component</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Internet Connectivity</h3>
	<h3>Power Accessibility</h3>

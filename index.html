	<h2><p>Definition</p></h2>
	The Global Communications Connectivity Index is an index that attempts to quantify how well connected a country is to the rest of the world based on its populations' ability to communicate through electronic means.
	<h2><p>Purpose</p></h2>
	The purpose of this index is to give insight as to which countries have populations that are best connected to each other and to the rest of the world.
	<h2><p>Methodology</p></h2>
	The Global Communications Connectivity Index is a score made up of a single number between 0 and 100 and is based on the three ways in which electronic communication takes place: through the internet, over a landline, or through a cellular device. Electrical access is also factored due to the need for power to communicate. The Index has four subscores for each of the following four categories:
	<ul>
		<li>Mobile Connectivity (30 points)</li>
		<li>Internet Connectivity (30 points)</li>
		<li>Landline Connectivity (15 points)</li>
		<li>Power Accessibility (25 points)</li>
	</ul>
	Each subscore is first scored out of 100 points, then brought down to its appropriate weight in the total score calculation.
	<h3>Mobile Connectivity</h3>
	The Mobile Connectivity subscore is directly based on a country's Mobile Subscriptions per 100 people. This subscore has two components:
	<ul>
		<li>Saturation Component (80 points)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Up to and including the first 100 subscriptions per 100 people, each subscriber contributes 0.8 points (1:1 ratio).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Efficiency Component (20 points)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				From the 101st subscriber to the 200th subscriber, each subscriber contributes 0.2 points. Any additional subscriber beyond 200 contributes nothing.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	 A perfect score would mean that each person has 2 subscriptions - one for work, one for personal use. Connectivity wise, thereâ€™s diminishing returns after each person has one subscription (on average). Therefore, this sub-score is weighted more heavily towards the first 100 subscribers per 100 people. In the context of quantifying connectivity, there is a negligible effect on people having more than two subscriptions.
